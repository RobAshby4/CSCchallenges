challenge 1 is to either somehow crack the password on the ELF generated from ch1.c, or use ghidra to decompile and see how it works (this is easier than cracking). The user then has to take the python code that is generated and bitshift the members of the array right by one then go to the address generated and find the flag in the blank html page.
